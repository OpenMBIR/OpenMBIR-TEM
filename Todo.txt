* Write the reconstruction as a .mrc file
* Implement Target Gain estimation based on input data file.
* Do we allow the user to set the SigmaX or do we always calculate it internally.
* Determine how to handle all the intermediate files.
* Streamline progress feedback to the GUI
* Add more "Cancel" checks in the code
* Update command line SOC to use MultiResolutionSOC instead
* Parallelize the code
* Turn doubles to floats to save memory. 
* Add an option to switch off #define for Joint_Estimation and #Noise estimation.
* Enable Bright-Field .mrc input to GUI
* Implement reconstruction when Bright-Field is available - Done. Venkat 5/30
* Do more tests of the automatic SigmaX calculation based on TargetGain - is it robust? 
* While choosing a region to recons. for multi-resolution need subvolume
to be a proper multiple of xz size at all resolutions 
* Make a command line version of the code so that user can run multiple instances using script files if needed.
