  Add command line options for user defined subvolume to use for reconstruction

 from .mrc file or calc'ed from user subvoiume
SinoN_r  -= Number of voxels in x1025
SinoN_t  = Number of voxels in Y
1025  

SinoN_theta - Number of tilts from mrc file
SinoDelta_r/t - From FEI header PixelSize in NANOMETERS!!!! Do the conversion
SinoAngles - From .mrc file->Fei Headers


----

From User which defines a sub volume
N_tStart
N_tEnd
N_rStart
N_rEnd

View Mask indices from User (optional)

From User - Size in nm of output pixel
GeomDeltaXZ
GeomDeltaXY

From User - 
GeomLengthZ - Thickness of sample in nm

Read data from file and copy into Sinogram->counts in proper orientation

**Notes on code bugs 12/5/2011****
1) ViewMask Is not being initialized anywhere. Earlier this was set to 1 if a view from the original sinogram was selected or not 

2) GainsOffset File is not being read in correctly . the string containing the file name seems to be buggy. 

3) Output is not being written correctly
