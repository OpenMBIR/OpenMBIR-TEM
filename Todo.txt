* Do we allow the user to set the SigmaX or do we always calculate it internally.

* Streamline progress feedback to the GUI
* Add more "Cancel" checks in the code
* Turn doubles to floats to save memory. 
* Add an option to switch off #define for Joint_Estimation and #Noise estimation.

* Need to enable a quick load option to continue the reconstruction for a few 
more iterations. This will need reading the final rec, offset, gain and var.

Stuff Completed
 
* Implement Target Gain estimation based on input data file.- Done. Venkat 6/14
* Bug in name of the final sinogram file - Done.Venkat/Mike 6/13/2012
* While choosing a region to recons. for multi-resolution need subvolume
to be a proper multiple of xz size at all resolutions - Done. Venkat 6/14/2012
* Parallelize the code - Done by Mike 6/12/2012
* Enable Bright-Field .mrc input to GUI - Done. Venkat. 
* Implement reconstruction when Bright-Field is available - Done. Venkat 5/30
* Do more tests of the automatic SigmaX calculation based on TargetGain - is it robust? - Done. Venkat 6/14/2012
* Make a command line version of the code so that user can run multiple instances using script files if needed. - Done. Venkat 6/24/2012
